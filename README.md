# What I've been working on

- A magic sqare artwork that generates scalable SVGs and expoerts scalabale PDFs (code mostly Fania, research mostly me)
- Archiving [Emergency Artlab](https://e-artlab.com) work done around 2001 with Mike Quantrill
- Using Static Site Generator (SSG) [Nanoc](https://nanoc.app) (I like it a lot better than Jekyll) with one extremely complex and another simpler website. I’ve contributed to the Nanoc website in the past.
- Moving a lot of former fiction and poetry to Markdown ()
- Cataloguing and listing my [vintage Apple Mac hardware](https://daveeveritt.github.io/vintage-mac-lists/) and software (mainly to sell or give to worthy collectors)
- Making commonly-used website features into compact ready-mades: [CSS Lightbox](https://daveeveritt.github.io/css-lightbox/), [bookmarkable CSS tabs](https://daveeveritt.github.io/css-sibling-tabs/),
- Making CheatSheets in Markdown for my own quickreference (e,g, [GIT](https://daveeveritt.github.io/git-minimal/), [CSS Flexbox](), ) I also sent them to students when I was teaching front-end web technologies
- Writing up my [late father’s memoirs](https://daveeveritt.github.io/bill-everitt-memoirs/)
- Reinterpreting the principles of the [Unix Philosophy for Real Life](https://daveeveritt.github.io/unix-for-life/)
- Many other things for which I use GitHub

<small>I used to use [Wakatime](https://wakatime.com/dashboard) to track my use of various languages (and took screen shots of all my Wakatime pie charts but it didn’t really help me in any way and bugged out sometimes.</small>
