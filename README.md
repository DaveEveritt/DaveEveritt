# What I've been working on

- A magic sqare artwork that generates scalable SVGs and expoerts scalabale PDFs (code mostly Fania, research mostly me)
- Archiving [Emergency Artlab](https://e-artlab.com) work done around 2001 with Mike Quantrill
- Using Static Site Generator (SSG) [Nanoc](https://nanoc.app) (I like it a lot better than Jekyll) with one extremely complex and another simpler website. I’ve contributed to the Nanoc website in the past.
- Moving a lot of former fiction and poetry to Markdown (private repos for now)
- Cataloguing and listing my [vintage Apple Mac hardware](https://daveeveritt.github.io/vintage-mac-lists/) and software (mainly to sell or give to worthy collectors)
- Making commonly-used website features into compact ready-mades: [CSS Lightbox](https://daveeveritt.github.io/css-lightbox/), [bookmarkable CSS tabs](https://daveeveritt.github.io/css-sibling-tabs/),
- Making CheatSheets in [Markdown](https://daveeveritt.github.io/markdown-overview/#/markdown "A presentation I made to explain Markdown") for my own quickreference (e,g, [GIT](https://daveeveritt.github.io/git-minimal/), [CSS Flexbox](), ) I also sent them to students when I was teaching front-end web technologies
- Writing up my [late father’s memoirs](https://daveeveritt.github.io/bill-everitt-memoirs/)
- Reinterpreting the principles of the [Unix Philosophy for Real Life](https://daveeveritt.github.io/unix-for-life/)
- Pondering a rewrite of the [tutorial website](https://daveeveritt.github.io/web-coding-first-site/) used for my [Web Coding First Steps](https://leanpub.com/webcodingfirststeps) book on LeanPub
- A very minimal [decision-maker](https://daveeveritt.github.io/decision-maker/), because I needed one myself. Caveat: it’s bare-bones and has some non-critical bugs, and I am not repsonsible for anything you do after using it ;-)
- Maintaining the uptime of an artwork (with Fania) [Personal Space](https://daveeveritt.github.io/space-weather-words/) that tracks solar weather and matches text from hundreds of diary entries (from a project with [Alice Charlotte-Bell](https://www.alicecharlottebell.com) to its intensity
- Many other things for which I use GitHub

<small>I used to use [Wakatime](https://wakatime.com/dashboard) to track my use of various languages (and took screen shots of all my Wakatime pie charts) but it didn’t really help me in any way and bugged out sometimes.</small>
