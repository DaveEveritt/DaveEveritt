# What I've been working on

I used to use Wakatime to track my use of various languages, but after a couple of weeks where it failed to update, I decided to stop because:

1. it doesn’t really help me do anything
2. I don’t have the time or patience to debug it

Goodbye [Wakatime](https://wakatime.com/dashboard), and thanks for all the fish.

**Postscript**: I took a screen shot of all my Wakatime pie charts, might put them up here when I have nothing else to do (unlikely!)
