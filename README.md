The Wakatime readout should be above - see [the waka-readme repo](https://github.com/athul/waka-readme) and the [other page about this](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/waka-readme) because the instructions aren't really clear and seem to end with "That's it! The Action runs everyday at 00.00 UTC" which makes the rest of the text look optional.
